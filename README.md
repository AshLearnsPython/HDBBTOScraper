# HDBBTOScraper

This is my first ever program.

This program uses Python, and several libraries, including Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Regular Expressions and Openpyxcl.
The program navigates to HDB's BTO page, and extracts the list of units and its associated price, road name, block name and lease.

I used to do this manually.
